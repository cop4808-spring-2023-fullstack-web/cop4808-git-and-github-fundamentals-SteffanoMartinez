Steffano Martinez - COP4808 

In this repository we added 4 new functions to the calculator, as operators, while 3 are in reality singular operand driven operators while 1 of the functions is a very useful constant $\pi$.

# Square root function:

Most of the modifications involved internal changes to the HTML, CSS, and JS files. The intent was to use current existing functionalities to prevent external calling errors to the calculator. The explicit details on how these changes where made can be found in the documentation PDF within the REPO.
